# Classification-US-Election
A machine learning analysis of the 2016 U.S. primary elections, focusing on predicting whether Donald Trump won the majority of Republican votes in a county. The project combines voting results with county-level socioeconomic data and evaluates multiple classification models (LDA, GLM, KNN) to compare their performance.

All models achieved similar accuracy (≈71–72%), a clear improvement over random guessing. KNN showed a slight numerical advantage, but differences across models were not statistically significant.
